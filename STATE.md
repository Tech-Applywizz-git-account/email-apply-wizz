  - Status: PASS
  - Implementation/fix commit: f72998af4041cb094d66d727cc88a01815ce4621
  - Independent review verdict: APPROVED
  - Reviewer: Fable independent re-review
  - Blocking findings: none

Current slice:
- Slice 12 Phase A implemented: dashboard-session authorization layer underneath retained Basic Auth
- Status: PASS
- Approved plan commit: 29b31e9081d74d5631f735c97c14232ea626fbe6
- Pre-work HEAD: 29b31e9081d74d5631f735c97c14232ea626fbe6
- Implementation commit: c20863990b2b926ac68e1232934034f943593843
- Independent reviewer verdict: APPROVED
- Reviewer: Claude/Fable independent code and security review
- Blocking findings: none
- Basic Auth remains active.
- Phase B remains unimplemented and blocked.
- No push or deployment has occurred.

Current rules:
- Basic Auth must remain active until an explicitly approved slice changes it.
- No push or deploy without explicit Ramakrishna approval.
- No middleware switch without an approved slice.
- No secret values in state files.
- No migrations without explicit approval.
- Every implementation must be reviewed before the next slice.
- Every slice must run tests, lint, and build.
- Stop at every human approval gate.

Slice 11 approval evidence:
- Playwright: 12/12 passed
- Login-page unit tests: 9/9 passed
- Dashboard-auth tests: 84/84 passed
- Full Vitest: 53 files / 433 tests passed
- Lint passed
- Build passed
- /dashboard restored byte-for-byte from fdd1caf
- Auth UI moved to /dashboard/login
- Login redirect now depends on full server-side session validation with getDashboardSessionByToken, not cookie presence
- No push or deployment has occurred

Slice 11 non-blocking observations:
- During successful login/setup navigation, the submission lock may be released before router.replace("/overview") completes, allowing a cosmetic generic-error flash on a rapid re-click. No duplicate request or sensitive exposure occurs.
- A genuine valid-session database-backed E2E test remains deferred to the future middleware/session-switch work.
- Production rollout still requires DASHBOARD_TOTP_ENCRYPTION_KEY, DASHBOARD_LOGIN_CHALLENGE_SECRET, seeded dashboard_users, and completion/review of the middleware/session-switch slice.

Next expected human-approved task:
- Checkpoint push of worker-preflight after Slice 12 Phase A documentation closure; no deploy.

Last run:
- 2026-07-12: Slice 12 Phase A marked PASS from Claude/Fable APPROVED verdict; documentation closure only

Slice 12 Phase A implementation summary:
- Added server-only requireDashboardSession guard using the reviewed getDashboardSessionByToken helper.
- Guarded /dashboard, /overview, /live-monitor/email-arrival, /clients, /clients/[clientKey], /operations, /operations/interviews, /operations/interviews/[id], /review-queue, /applications, /applications/[applicationId], /mailboxes, and /ca-portfolio.
- Converted client-only mock operations pages to thin guarded server wrappers plus dedicated client components.
- Added POST /api/dashboard/auth/logout with Phase A Basic Auth, Origin validation, idempotent session revocation, and cookie clearing.
- Added logout action to the operations navigation with hard navigation to /dashboard/login.
- Added shared dashboard session cookie helper for set/clear consistency.
- Middleware remains Basic Auth only; no getDashboardSessionByToken import was added to middleware.
- app/dashboard/page.tsx DASHBOARD_SECRET check remains unchanged.
- Role-based authorization remains deferred; Slice 12 validates session usability only.
- Real database-backed valid-session E2E remains a Phase B prerequisite and was not claimed as completed in Phase A.

Slice 12 Phase A verification evidence:
- Focused guard/logout tests: 3 files / 43 tests passed
- Dashboard auth API tests: 7 files / 85 tests passed
- Login-page unit tests: 1 file / 9 tests passed
- DashboardAuth lib tests: 16 files / 115 tests passed
- Full Vitest: 56 files / 477 tests passed
- Playwright dashboard-auth desktop: 13/13 passed
- Lint passed
- Build passed with existing Next.js middleware deprecation warning
- git diff --check passed

Slice 12 Phase A non-blocking observations:
- logoutBusyRef is not reset after fetch failure, but the current hard navigation in finally prevents a persistent lock.
- Origin: null fails closed.
- Some guard failure-case labels reuse the same { ok: false } mocked path, while detailed distinctions remain covered by getDashboardSessionByToken() tests.
- Static route-guard coverage is a regression tripwire, not a substitute for the deferred real database-backed E2E.

Phase B prerequisites:
- Real database-backed valid-session E2E must revoke or expire a real valid session, then soft-navigate to another protected route and confirm denial.
- Real database-backed valid-session E2E must authenticate with a real valid session and confirm /dashboard renders the Email Tracker business UI.
- Phase B remains unimplemented and requires a separate approved plan before Basic Auth removal.

Loop readiness audit:
- 100/100 (L3), report-only safe start

Cost estimate:
- Daily Triage at L1 is above the suggested 100k/day cap on realistic usage; keep the loop report-only and low cadence until the next approved slice is needed.
