# Loop State — ApplyWizz Email Tracker

Project:
ApplyWizz Email Tracker — Dashboard Auth Phase 1

Repository:
~/Desktop/applywizard-email-tracker

Production:
https://email-apply-wizz.vercel.app

Current live authentication:
Basic Auth remains active.

Completed and reviewed:
- Slice 1: dashboard auth database migration
- Slice 2: server-only auth helpers
- Slice 3: session database helpers
- Slice 4: Microsoft Graph OTP sender
- Slice 5: OTP database flow helpers
- Slice 6: TOTP/Authenticator crypto helpers
- Slice 7: server-side auth orchestration
- Slice 8: OTP/TOTP rate limiting
- Slice 9: signed login challenges

Current slice:
- Slice 10 implemented: HTTP route handlers + secure session cookie wiring
- Pending review

Current rules:
- Basic Auth must remain active until an explicitly approved slice changes it.
- No push or deploy without explicit Ramakrishna approval.
- No middleware switch without an approved slice.
- No secret values in state files.
- No migrations without explicit approval.
- Every implementation must be reviewed before the next slice.
- Every slice must run tests, lint, and build.
- Stop at every human approval gate.

Next expected human-approved task:
- Slice 10 review: HTTP route handlers + secure session cookie wiring

Last run:
- 2026-07-11: Slice 10 implementation verified locally

Loop readiness audit:
- 100/100 (L3), report-only safe start

Cost estimate:
- Daily Triage at L1 is above the suggested 100k/day cap on realistic usage; keep the loop report-only and low cadence until the next approved slice is needed.
